Application Specifications

To start the application, go to the folder of the application in your terminal and type : npm run start. This will trigger the front end of the application on local host : 3000 . You can check the functionalities as you deem fit. 

To run the tests open up another terminal and go to the projects folder as you did before and type in the command : npm run test

Background Details

To make the application lightweight and avoid the complications involved in traditional react applications, this application was bootstrapped with create-react-app.

To dive deeper into the configuration, you may want to take a look at the package.json file. 

All the test configurations have been mentioned in the setupTests.js file. All the tests are in the __tests__  folder. 

Kindly go through the structure of the project and get back to me with further questions if any.
